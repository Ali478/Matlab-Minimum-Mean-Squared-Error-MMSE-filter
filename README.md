# Matlab-Minimum-Mean-Squared-Error-MMSE-filter
A minimum-mean-square-error filter is proposed to detect a noisy target in spatially nonoverlapping background noise. In this model, both the background noise that is spatially nonoverlapping with the target and the noise that is additive to the target and the input image are considered.
